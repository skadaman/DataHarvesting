#This code is meant to harvest data from the SPP ISO. Specifically Day Ahead and Realtime data.
#This code works. It retrieves the file from SPP. Now it needs to be automated. Make file name  be an input variable through
#the current days date. SPP uses a FTP to post files. 
#This code reaches that FTP and downloads the file to the current directory.
#FTP for SPP
